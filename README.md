### Above is a link to the walkthrough video showing how the routes work using Insomnia.
## Description:
### This is a back-end application to be used as a starter point for Social Media websites. This application includes the routes and models for Users, Friends, Thoughts, and Reactions.
## Installation:
### Clone or fork this repository from Github. Run `npm i` in your terminal to install dependencies. To use my seeds, run `node utils/seed.js` in the terminal. This will install the seeds into your MongoDB. Then, run `npm start` to run the application. *Note - this is a back-end application only so you will need a tool like "Insomnia" to check the routes or install your own front-end view. 
## Usage:
### This program is intended to be cloned or forked and used as the back-end starting point for a new social media website.
